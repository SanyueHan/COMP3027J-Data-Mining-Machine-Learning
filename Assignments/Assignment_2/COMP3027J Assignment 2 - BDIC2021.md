### Description
This is the BDIC COMP3027J Data Mining and Machine Learning Assignment 2.

The research of the stock market is currently one of the hottest topics in the field of data mining and machine learning. The purpose of this assignment is to discover how to use data mining and machine learning to solve the real stock market problem. The evaluation method for stock market forecasts will use stock returns. This assignment is a group project, and each group should have four members. Each group only needs to submit one solution.

In this assignment, there are no restrictions on data sources and styles. You can use numerical data, textual data, pictures, audios, etc.

For the stock market forecast, we will evaluate the forecast stock's return within a week (day & week). The predicted target time is the 13th week (May 24th ~ May 30th, 5 days). The target number of stocks is 50, please refer to Stock_Ticker_List.xlsx (on Kaggle). The stock market platform can search for stock data based on tickers (symbols).

Due to the high volatility of the stock market, it is difficult to actually successfully predict the trend of stock returns. This assignment will be ranked according to the prediction accuracy. Score based on the final group ranking. The final ranking results will be announced at the end of the 13th.

Group name: GroupXX (e.g. Group01)

### Evaluation
Competition Name: COMP3027J Assignment 2 - BDIC2021

Website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/comp3027j-assignment-2-bdic2021/overview

50 Stocks List:
Please refer to StockTickerList.xlsx in the Kaggle competition dataset.
Note: The order of the stocks in the final result should be the same as the order of the stocks in the file provided.

Result Format:

- Return: Do number prediction. Fill in the number part before the percent sign, and keep two decimal places for the number. e.g. for 5.326% enter 5.33


### Pre-Test Experiment
For everyone to test the model and test the submission result format, this assignment will provide a pre-test training experiment (the first two weeks of the actual prediction phase). The order of 50 stocks is the same as the sample data. The pre-test training data set will provide the daily opening price, closing price, the highest price, the lowest price, adjust the closing price and trading volume of each stock. The prediction results can be uploaded to Kaggle for evaluation and ranking to check whether the model predicts correctly and whether the format of the model result is correct.

The pre-test phase will start on May 3rd and end on May 16st. Training data can be obtained from Kaggle Dataset. After the pre-test phase is over, we will clear the leaderboard and no longer accept test data.

Please note that in the pre-training phase, only each set of forecast data can be uploaded. Do not upload real-time stock data to avoid interference with the leaderboard. (Teams whose answers are exactly the same as the test set will be removed and will not be allowed to participate in the pre-test)

## [My Submissions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/comp3027j-assignment-2-bdic2021/submissions)
You may select up to 1 submission to be used to count towards your final leaderboard score. If 1 submission are not selected, they will be automatically chosen based on your best submission scores on the public leaderboard. In the event that automatic selection is not suitable, manual selection instructions will be provided in the competition rules or by official forum announcement.

Your final score may not be based on the same exact subset of data as the public leaderboard, but rather a different private data subset of your full submission â€” your public score is only a rough indication of what your final score is.

You should thus choose submissions that will most likely be the best overall, and not necessarily on the public subset.
